# [EPCarpool](https://www.epcarpool.com)
The idea for EPCarpool was born at the first EPS Hackathon in January of 2024. The prompt for that competition was "How can we make EPS more sustainable?".
There are many ways we could approach this topic: We could build a website to raise awareness or we could greenify a component of EPS, but we decided to focus on the student life aspect of sustainability. How can students at EPS engage in climate-friendly actions, and how can they integrate it into a convenient lifestyle?
EPCarpool is a place that allows students to engage directly in lowering the footprint from transportation for school events: socials, sports, academic teams, and more. It allows us to work together to make EPS extracurriculars a more sustainable part of our culture and to promote greener ways of transportation. We see the value in carpooling, and we hope you do as well.

The vision of such a applicaiton is to allow for easier communication on carpooling to EPS based events.
