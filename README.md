EPShareRides
<h2 class="subtitle" style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">The idea for EPShare Rides was born at the first EPS Hackathon in January of 2024. The prompt for that competition was "How can we make EPS more sustainable?". </h2>
            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 12px;margin-bottom: 10px">There are many ways we could approach this topic: We could build a website to raise awareness or we could greenify a component of EPS, but we decided to focus on the student life aspect of sustainability. How can students at EPS engage in climate-friendly actions, and how can they integrate it into a convenient lifestyle?</p>
            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 12px">EPShare Rides is a place that allows students to engage directly in lowering the footprint from transportation for school events: socials, sports, academic teams, and more. It allows us to work together to make EPS extracurriculars a more sustainable part of our culture and to promote greener ways of transportation. We see the value in carpooling, and we hope you do as well.</p>
